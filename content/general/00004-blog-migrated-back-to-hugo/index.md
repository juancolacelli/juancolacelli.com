Today I migrated the website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) was fine, but it requires a lot of attention, and you lose a lot of control, it's not for me at least.

I will be upgrading [GNU Elefantoj](https://gitlab.com/juancolacelli/elefantoj), because it's my own theme, used on this website.
