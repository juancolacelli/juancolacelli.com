I'm woking on my new game, it doesn't have a name yet (I just call it *"Jump Game"*), but it has a lot of love already &hearts;.

Jump Game is about **jumping and evading spikes**. It looks simple but as you go through levels it becomes harder.

The game source code is completely made with GDScript in [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine and for the sprites I used [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org/) with [PICO-8](https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8) color palette.

Take a look to the first game screenshot:

Soon I will be posting more news about it. **Stay in contact!**
