I received a lot of comments about laser being a little frustrating, so I decided to rework it. Another issue was the fast camera movement, I reworked it too.

Introducing new items:

![2 lives](items2.png) 2 lives

![Jetpack](items3.png) Jetpack

![Yellow battery](items4.png) Yellow battery

![Red battery](items5.png) Red battery
