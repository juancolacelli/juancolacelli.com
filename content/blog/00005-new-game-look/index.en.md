I have been working a lot on the game, that's why I couldn't post on weekend :( but I really like how it's looking now.

I dropped [PICO-8](https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8) color palette, now I'll be using [Bubblegum 16](https://lospec.com/palette-list/bubblegum-16), because it has really flashy colors and it gives a new fresh look to the game.

*Minor changes*
- Dotted-line blocks will toggle all at once (synchronized).
- Floor now will blink 3 times before disappearing.
- Floor tilesets now have start, middle and end
