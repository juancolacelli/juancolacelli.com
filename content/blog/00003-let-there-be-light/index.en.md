Well... I'm not God, but I added light to my new game.

_Changes made_

-   Light shader has been added, it will just use [PICO-8](https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8) color palette colors.
-   Light has been added to player.
-   Floor tiles (without one way collision) will occlude light.
-   Bricks and stars backgrounds have been added.
-   Light will be reflected on bricks and not in the stars.
