Today I added lava and dotted-line blocks to my new game.

Lava will go up constantly pushing the player to be faster, and dotted-line blocks are just blocks that appear and disappear constantly.

*Minor changes*
- Blocks tileset improved.
- Player will no longer be stuck between two tiles.

I'm looking for a name for my new game, if you can help me, please feel free to [contact me!](/about)
