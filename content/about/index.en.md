## Who am I

![Juan Colacelli](jc_with_cats.gif)

I'm Juan Colacelli, a **solo indie game developer** focused on **retro pixel art games**.

After more than twenty years as a professional software developer, I discovered my long-rooted passion for [pixel art]({{< ref "/tags/pixelart" >}}) and [game development]({{< ref "/tags/gamedev" >}}).

## Tools

![Juan Colacelli](jc_matrix.gif)

I mostly use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) or [SDL](https://libsdl.org) for my games, [Vim](https://vim.org) as my code editor and [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) for my drawings.
