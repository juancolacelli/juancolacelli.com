I am Juan Colacelli, You may know me as the developer of [DROID7]({{< ref "/games/droid7" >}}).

I am a solo indie gamedev focused on retro pixelart games.

After working over 15 years at companies and graduating as Software Analyst, I started my current indie game developer career.

I am passionate about development, game development, pixelart and music.

I am also a fan of martial arts, and currently I reached blue belt grade in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at Quique Denegri academy.
