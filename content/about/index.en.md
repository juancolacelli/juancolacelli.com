## Who am I

I'm Juan Colacelli, a solo indie game developer focused on retro pixelart games.

After more than twenty years as a professional software developer, I discovered my long-rooted passion for pixelart and game development.

## Tools

I mostly use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) or [SDL](https://libsdl.org) for my games, [Vim](https://vim.org) as my code editor and [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) for my drawings.
