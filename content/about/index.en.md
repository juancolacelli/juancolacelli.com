## Who am I

![With Cats](with_cats.gif)

Well, **my name is Juan Colacelli and I'm from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·**.

I'm a **solo indie game developer** focused on **retro pixel art games**.

After more than twenty years as a professional software developer, I discovered my long-rooted passion for pixel art and [game development]({{< ref "/tags/gamedev" >}}).

## Tools

![Matrix](matrix.gif)

I mostly use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) or [SDL](https://libsdl.org) for my games, [Vim](https://vim.org) as my code editor and [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) for my drawings.
