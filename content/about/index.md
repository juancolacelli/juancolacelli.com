I'm Juan Colacelli, creator of [DROID7](/droid7).

After working over 15 years at companies and graduating as Software Analyst, I started my current indie [game developer](/tags/gamedev) career.

I'm passionate about [development](/tags/dev), [game development](/tags/gamedev), [pixelart](/tags/pixelart) and music.

I'm also a fan of martial arts, and currently I reached blue belt grade in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at Quique Denegri academy.
